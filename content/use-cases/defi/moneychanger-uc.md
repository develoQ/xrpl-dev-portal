# Decentralized Exchange

The XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange consists of an unlimited number of currency pairs, tracked on-demand when users make trades. A currency pair can consist of XRP and a token or two different tokens; tokens are always identified by the combination of an issuer and a currency code. Therefore, it is possible to trade between two tokens with the same currency code and different issuers, or the same issuer and different currency codes.

Get started by following the steps in [Trade in the Decentralized Exchange](trade-in-the-decentralized-exchange.html).
