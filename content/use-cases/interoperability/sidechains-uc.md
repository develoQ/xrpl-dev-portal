# Sidechains (Beta)

_As an XRP Ledger developer, I want to create my own, independent ledger instance that can transfer value with the XRP Ledger in the form of XRP and other tokens._

A sidechain is an independent ledger with its own consensus algorithm and transaction types and rules. It acts as its own blockchain. Federation enables value in the form of XRP and other tokens to move efficiently between a sidechain and an XRP Ledger mainchain.
