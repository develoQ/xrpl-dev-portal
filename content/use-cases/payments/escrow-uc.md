# Escrow

A traditional escrow is a contract between two parties to facilitate risky financial transactions. Funds are held by an impartial third party, guaranteeing its availability.  The funds are only released to their intended recipients when conditions specified by the contract are met. This method ensures both parties meet their obligations.

The XRP Ledger takes escrow a step further, replacing the third party with an automated system built into the ledger. An escrow locks up XRP, which cannot be used or destroyed until conditions are met.
