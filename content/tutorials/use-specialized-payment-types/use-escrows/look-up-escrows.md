# Look up Escrows

All pending escrows are stored in the ledger as [Escrow objects](escrow.html). You can look them up by the sender's address or the destination address.

**Note:** You can only look up pending escrow objects by destination address if those escrows were created after the [fix1523 amendment][] was enabled on 2017-11-14.

Use the [account_objects method][], where the sender or destination address is the `account` value.

Request:

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->

_Websocket_

```json
{% include '_code-samples/escrow/websocket/account_objects-request.json' %}
```

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_END -->

The response includes all pending escrow objects with `rfztBskAVszuS3s5Kq7zDS74QtHrw893fm`, where the sender address is the `Account` value, or the destination address is the `Destination` value.

<!-- MULTICODE_BLOCK_START -->
